## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **docker/**: Dockerfiles and related configuration for each service (DB, Message Queue, Spark Master/Worker, Dashboard).
- **config/**: Configuration files for logging, analytics, and other settings.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for setting up the environment, running the ETL pipeline, and utility functions.
- **src/**: Source code for the dashboard application and analytics modules.
- **data/**: Directory for storing raw, processed, and supplementary data files.
- **logs/**: Log files generated by the ETL processes and dashboard.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SoniaBorsi/Healthcare-Resource-Allocation.git
   cd Healthcare-Resource-Allocation
2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   bash run.sh
3. **Wait for the the data to be loaded into the db**
   This usually takes about 1 hour, depending on your internet connection
4. **Access the dashboard**
   Got to localhost:8080 and explore all the analytics

## Dashboard Demo
This application is designed to facilitate healthcare resource allocation through data-driven insights. Navigate through the various sections using the sidebar to explore different metrics and tools available to you:
- *Measures*: for detailed metrics for various healthcare measures across different states in Australia
- *Hospitals*: for a comprehensive analysis of hospitals across different states
- *Budget*: for a a comprehensive visual analysis of healthcare expenditure data

## Data Sources

Healthcare data utilized in this project is primarily extracted from the [Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) API](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data/myhospitals/content/api), an open and freely accessible resource. The available data includes:

- **Hospital Data**
- **Multi-Level Data**
- **Geographic Data**

In addition, this project integrates healthcare data with supplementary datasets provided by the [Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](https://www.abs.gov.au) to enrich the analysis and ensure comprehensive insights.
