# Healthcare Analytics Platform

Welcome to the **Healthcare Analytics Platform** repository! This project is a comprehensive solution designed to extract, transform, analyze, and visualize healthcare data. It leverages a multi-container Docker setup to manage various services including a database, message queue, Spark cluster, and a Flask-based dashboard. The platform is built with scalability, modularity, and ease of use in mind, making it ideal for healthcare data scientists, analysts, and engineers.

## Key Features
- **ETL Pipeline**: Efficient extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of healthcare data using Python scripts.
- **Scalable Data Processing**: Distributed data processing using Apache Spark, with a master and multiple worker nodes configured in Docker.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A Flask-based web dashboard for visualizing healthcare analytics, including patient data, outcomes, and trends.
- **Multi-Container Architecture**: Microservices architecture managed via Docker Compose, with dedicated containers for each service:
  - **Database**: Persistent storage for processed and raw healthcare data.
  - **Message Queue**: Asynchronous task management using rabbitmq
  - **Spark Cluster**: Distributed data processing with a master node and worker nodes .
  - **Dashboard**: User-facing dashboard for analytics and reporting.
- **Automated Setup**: Setup scripts and Dockerfiles are provided for seamless installation and deployment.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **docker/**: Dockerfiles and related configuration for each service (DB, Message Queue, Spark Master/Worker, Dashboard).
- **config/**: Configuration files for logging, analytics, and other settings.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for setting up the environment, running the ETL pipeline, and utility functions.
- **src/**: Source code for the dashboard application and analytics modules.
- **data/**: Directory for storing raw, processed, and supplementary data files.
- **logs/**: Log files generated by the ETL processes and dashboard.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SoniaBorsi/Healthcare-Resource-Allocation.git
   cd Healthcare-Resource-Allocation
2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   bash run.sh
3. **Wait for the the data to be loaded into the db**
   This usually takes about 1 hour, depending on your internet connection
4. **Access the dashboard**
   Got to localhost:8080 and explore all the analytics

Alternatevely, you can consult the hosted version without the need for configuring and downloading the data
